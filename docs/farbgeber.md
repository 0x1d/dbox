# Farbgeber
> A central color generator to provide an uniform colorscheme that is harmonious, yet dynamically changing the color.
> 
> The color generator makes sure that all colors of the rainbow are represented equally often for the same duration. It produces 6 colors for every second in an hour. These 5 colors are very similar and can be used for gradients or backgrounds with movement. The 6th color is in a harmony contrast with the first color and should be used only a little and as a contrast. Rule of thumb: 90-100% of the LEDs should be in one of the 5 basic variations and 0-10% in the contrasting color.
